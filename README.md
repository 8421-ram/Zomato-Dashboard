# Project Overview
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a Zomato dashboard that provides a visual representation of sales data, ratings, and order quantities for Zomato across different cities and food categories.
Here are the insights from the dashboard:

## Zomato Overview:
The company is providing services in 150,281 locations and has connected with 100,000 restaurants, from which it has received 150,281 orders.

## Key Metrics:
__Amount: 987M__ (presumably this is the revenue or sales amount in a given currency)\
__Quantity: 2M__ (this could refer to the number of items sold or delivered)\
__Rating: 148K__ (this might represent an aggregate score or number of ratings received)\
__Orders: 150K__ (total orders processed)

## Category Breakdown:
__Non-Veg:__ 106M in sales with a rating of 10K\
__Veg:__ 122M in sales with a rating of 12K\
__Others:__ 24M in sales with a rating of 927

## Sales by City (Overall City Amount):
The bar chart shows the sales amount by city, with the top cities listed as Tirupati, Electronic City, Baner (Pune), Raipur, and others. The exact amounts are not visible, but the chart provides a visual comparison of sales across different cities.

## Sales Over Time (Amount Sales):
A line graph depicts the sales amount over time from 2017 to 2020, with a peak in 2018 at 0.41 billion, a slight decrease in 2019 to 0.34 billion, and a more significant drop in 2020 to 0.14 billion.

## Summary:
The dashboard provides a quick visual summary of Zomato's performance in terms of sales, order quantity, ratings, and distribution across different types of food and locations. The data suggests a strong presence in multiple cities and a fluctuation in sales over the observed years.
